# Interactive map with plantable markers and pan-zoom
## React + JS Canvas + Typescript

    This project is a code snippet from a bigger project regarding world creation. 
It is a fully zoomable, pannable and adjustable canvas. You can plant markers with any name and they will be shown on a map. The code structure is very flexible and can be easuly adjusted or implemented into any project in no time. The code is optimized with map caching, so amount of http request is minimal and is zero when fully loaded.
    Unfortunately when it comes to zooming this public version works best with laptop touchpad, the mouse patch will not be publushed.
